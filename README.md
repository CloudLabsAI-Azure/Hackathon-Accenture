## About the Hackathon Environment
   | Resources | Value | Remarks |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Enabled Services | `Azure OpenAI`, `Other Azure Resources` | You can explore the any Azure services. |
   | Azure Credit | 500 USD | The consumption limit is set on Azure spend to 500 USD |
   | Credit Alerts | Credit Alerts are set on consumption of 50%, 75%, 80%, 95%, and 100% of total Azure credits. | Make sure to check your registered email's inbox for any alert-related mails.

1. Every team member gets their own Azure username and password, with owner access on 1 Azure subscription shared by entire team.

1. USD 500 Azure Credit limit is for entire team, not on individual basis.

1. You will have owner role access on the Azure subscription, granting you the freedom to explore the features of Azure OpenAI and other Azure Services. It is recommended to utilize this environment solely for learning purposes.

1. The Azure credit consumption encompasses the operational expenses of all the Azure resources. This Azure Credit consumption will not be used for any third-party subscription, licenses requested during sandbox and will be reserved only for Azure Resources.

1. It is recommended to use the trial version for any third-party subscriptions and licenses which are not offered by Microsoft.

1. Due to the sandbox's fixed budget of $500 USD, please refrain from deploying any resources unrelated to the Sandbox, as this will consume the Azure credit leading to the deallocation of the Sandbox as soon as the credit limit is reached.
